The Mahabharata is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana. Attributed to the sage Vyasa, the Mahabharata is a sprawling narrative that consists of approximately 100,000 shlokas (verses) and is divided into 18 parvas (books or sections). The epic centers around the great Kurukshetra War and explores various philosophical and moral dilemmas. It includes the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text revered for its teachings on duty and righteousness.

Lord Arjuna:
Arjuna is one of the central characters in the Mahabharata and a key member of the Pandavas, the protagonists of the epic. He is the third son of King Pandu and Queen Kunti, born through divine boons. Arjuna is renowned for his exceptional skills in archery, making him a formidable warrior on the battlefield.</p>
